I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University. I study how politics and markets shape one another using quantitative methods. Around the world, firms are increasingly exposed to political risks — from regulation and polarisation at home to conflict and geopolitical realignment abroad. My research seeks to understand how these risks affect the economy, how firms and governments respond, and what this means for democracy and globalization.

Before my PhD, I studied a BSc (Hons) in Economics at the University of Warwick and a Dual Masters in International Economic Policy / Political Economy at Sciences Po / London School of Economics. I also worked as a pre-doctoral research fellow at Universitat Pompeu Fabra with Professor Ruben Durante and as an investment banking analyst at Goldman Sachs.
