I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University. I study how politics and markets shape one another using quantitative methods. Around the world, firms are increasingly exposed to political risks â€” from regulation and polarisation at home to conflict and geopolitical realignment abroad. My research seeks to understand how these risks affect the economy, how firms and governments respond, and what this means for democracy and globalization. My research has been published or is forthcoming in the _British Journal of Political Science_ and the _Journal of Political Economy: Microeconomics_.
